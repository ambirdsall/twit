This is a twitter clone, to practice integrating a rails-api backend with a
separate backbone front-end app.

## Todo
#### Back-end
[x] create models
[ ] seed db
[ ] add authentication
[ ] add validations
[ ] bang out naive implementation of all queries
[ ] then make them all efficient, with the proper indeces and eager-loading

#### Front-end
[ ] get dependencies, `package.json` in order
[ ] create models
[ ] make styling decent
[ ] extract partials
[ ] routing issues?
